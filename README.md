Here's my overview of performing data analysis in Excel ;
 
First and foremost☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽,

1. Data Acquisition and Import:
👉🏽 Identify data sources whether it were Internal databases, CSV files, web scraping, APIs, etc. I used Kaggle to query my data.
👉🏽 Import data using dedicated connectors for structured sources or copy-paste for less structured data. I straight away downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
👉🏽 Formatting to ensure data is well-formatted, consistent, and adheres to best practices. 

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
👉🏽 I identified and removed errors by checking for missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, and typos.
👉🏽 Applied Data cleansing techniques by using functions like VLOOKUP, FIND, REPLACE, TRIM and REMOVE DUPLICATES. 
👉🏽 Data is transformed by converting formats, creating calculated columns, and grouping data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
👉🏽 Descriptive statistics are calculated, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
👉🏽 Data visualization is performed through charts like bar graphs and lines to visualize patterns and trends.
👉🏽 Conditional formatting is applied to highlight specific data points or ranges based on conditions.

4. Data Manipulation and Analysis:
👉🏽 Data is sorted and filtered based on specific criteria to focus on relevant subsets.
👉🏽 PivotTables and slicers are used to quickly summarize and analyze large datasets from different perspectives.
👉🏽 Formulas and functions, such as AVERAGE, COUNTIF, and SUMIFS, are employed for complex calculations and analysis.

5. Reporting and Communication:
👉🏽 I summarize findings using tables, charts, and text to present insights and conclusions.
👉🏽 Dashboards are created for continuous data monitoring and visualization.
👉🏽 Data is exported to other tools (Power BI, Tableau) for more advanced analysis or reporting.

Tips and Insights :
👉🏽 While the shortcut Alt + H + O + I quickly adjusts all column widths, be mindful that it may not always lead to optimal results. Other alternatives are using AutoFit, Manual Adjustment and Customize column width. 
👉🏽 The Analyze Data function is indeed a powerful tool for beginners and experts alike. As for myself, still considered 'green' in the data analysis field this function is a game-changer with its ability to guide you through exploratory data analysis that saves time and simplifies complex tasks.
👉🏽 To leverage it effectively it help me to ;
- Clearly define your goal: What insights are we seeking from the data?
- Choose the appropriate tool: Analyze Data offers various options like descriptive statistics, correlations, regressions, and more. Select the tool that best aligns with our goal.
- Interpret the results: Don't just copy-paste the output. Understand what the numbers mean and translate them into clear, actionable insights.
👉🏽 Use consistent formatting throughout our spreadsheet for a polished look.
👉🏽 Employ clear and concise data labels and comments for easy understanding.
👉🏽  Proofread our work carefully before sharing it with others.
